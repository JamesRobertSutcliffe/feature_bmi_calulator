# feature_bmi_calulator

As you may have noticed in my Flexbox project I initially set out to build a drum machine. Although this would have been cool, I figured I was not quite ready and would have essentially been copying to get it done. I opted for something a lot more boring in comparison, but I managed to start building from the ground up and consulted google only when needed. I got to grips with JS a little further and wrote some decent if else statments and functions that seemed to work well. I also improved my knowledge of dom manipulation, grabbing elements by ID. It was a challenge but I learned a lot.
